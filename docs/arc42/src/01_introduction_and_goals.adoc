=== Goals

Despite widespread use, there are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for Baloise employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.

This document is therefore a guide, primarily for Baloise employees, on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source code. There are a few references to internal Baloise sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal resources.

The document should support and enable "permissionless innovation" (ask for forgiveness, not permission) as we want to foster a new default to openness at Baloise.

=== Requirements Overview
