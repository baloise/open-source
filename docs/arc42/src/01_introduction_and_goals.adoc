[[section-introduction-and-goals]]
=== Goals

The document should support and enable "permissionless innovation" (ask for forgiveness, not permission) as we want to foster a new default to openness at Baloise.

Despite widespread use, there are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for Baloise employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common.

This document is therefore a guide, primarily for Baloise employees, on how to use, adopt, modify and release Open Source code. There are a few references to internal Baloise sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal resources.

This document is supposed to cover all three engineering driven steps of: using open source, contributing to open source as well as championing an individual open source project https://baloise.github.io/open-source/docs/md/goals/uplift.html#legend[enabling an uplift] and being ready for strategic investments in that area.

[[section-code-of-conduct]]
=== Code of Conduct

As a general rule, it is the responsibility of each individual employee to ensure his or her behaviour is in keeping with legal and ethical principles. To provide basic behavioural guidelines, we link our to https://baloise.github.io/open-source/docs/md/guides/governance.html#code-of-conduct[code of conduct(s)] containing these essential ethical and legal rules.
