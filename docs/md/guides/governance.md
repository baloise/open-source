As a general rule, it is the responsibility of each individual employee to ensure his or her behaviour is in keeping with legal and ethical principles. To provide basic behavioural guidelines, the Baloise Group has developed a Code of Conduct (available in [English](https://www.baloise.com/dam/jcr:61f34c11-bcb8-4e44-b648-b80ede1d101f/code-of-conduct-baloise-english.pdf) and [Deutsch](https://www.baloise.com/dam/jcr:aad6ef59-b2f2-4c44-901d-b2247b07fb8e/code-of-conduct-baloise-deutsch.pdf)) containing essential ethical and legal rules.
