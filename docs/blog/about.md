# [open-insurance.org](https://open-insurance.org) - building common ground

Just very recently I've luckily had the chance to (once again) learn about the concept of [rapport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapport) and experience the importance of this pillar as a foundation for any kind of **relationship between (human) beings**. Usually the concept is applied to direct human-to-human contact and interaction: e.g. by aligning your body language, eye contact, used terminology or even your breathing rhythm to the person you want to build rapport with.

But what if once intention would be to build rapport to 
```
a) yet still unkown group of people and participants over 
b) a very indirect and decoupled medium "the internet" with
c) an (until now) quite conservative and closed industry sector? 
```

I guess that's what we're as [Baloise](https://www.baloise.com) currently aiming for with initiatives like: [open-insurance.org](https://open-insurance.org): to **build a common ground in terms of terminology, opportunities and challenges** we're facing (now and in future).

Nowadays the possibilities to provide and use mediums on a technical level are sheer unlimited: [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_source) collaboration models, platforms and tools such as [github.com/baloise](https://github.com/baloise) have been there for a pretty long time (in terms of the internet age). And yet we think only a very small percentage of potential open collaboration within businesses is already applied: the lack of rapport starts within a single company, spans across e.g. corporate group activies and ultimately also applies to complete industries.

We think [starting small](https://github.com/baloise/open-source#our-goals) and at the same time aiming for big(ger) ideas is a good approach - interested in joining in? [Get in touch](mailto:Group.CH_Open-Source@baloise.ch) with us!
