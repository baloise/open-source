# [open-insurance.org](https://open-insurance.org) - building common ground

Just very recently I've luckily had the chance to (once again) learn about the concept of [rapport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rapport) and experience the importance of this pillar as a foundation for any kind of **relationship between (human) beings**. Usually the concept is applied to direct human-to-human contact and interaction: e.g. by aligning your body language, eye contact, used terminology or even your breathing rhythm to the person you want to build rapport with.

But what if one's intention would be to build rapport to 
```
a) a (yet still unknown) group of people and participants over 
b) a very indirect and decoupled medium "the internet" with
c) an (until now) quite conservative and closed industry sector? 
```

I guess that's what we're as [Baloise](https://www.baloise.com) currently aiming for with initiatives like: [open-insurance.org](https://open-insurance.org): to **build a common ground in terms of terminology, opportunities and challenges** we're facing now and in the upcoming future.

Nowadays the possibilities to provide and use mediums on a technical level are sheer unlimited: [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_source) collaboration models, tools and platforms such as [github.com](https://github.com/baloise) have been there for a pretty long time (in terms of the internet age). And yet we think only a very small percentage of potential open collaboration within businesses is already applied: a lack of rapport starts within a single company, spans across e.g. corporate group activities and ultimately also applies to complete industries.

But how to actually build it when being decoupled and not knowing with whom to interact? I guess it's just all about starting and thereby providing a space for rapport to grow! 2017 and 2018 have been very interesting years with regards to open-insurance movements. There have been a couple of activities of rapport-building we've noticed so far that we would like to share with you:

1) ["Setting up an open platform - open source makes the most of the entire industryâ€™s intelligence"](https://www.allianz.com/en/press/news/business/insurance/180129-allianz-sets-up-open-platform.html) by Allianz
2) a [whitepaper](https://github.com/OpenInsurance/whitepaper#open-insurance) by the [Open Insurance initiative (OPIN)](https://openinsurance.io)
3) ideas and workshops by [OpenCologne - the open insurance API working group](http://deliverythinking.com/insurance-to-stay/) - unfortunately this initiative seems to have been paused for quite a while now

We also think [starting small](https://github.com/baloise/open-source#our-goals) and at the same time aiming for big(ger) ideas is a good approach - so are you interested in joining in? [Get in touch](mailto:Group.CH_Open-Source@baloise.ch) with us now!
