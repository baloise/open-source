# open-source
Open-Source is part of the [Open Innovation movement @ Baloise](https://www.inside-it.ch/articles/51129).

The [relevance](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/#overview) of Open-Source (software) has been [constantly growing (in Switzerland)](https://oss-studie.ch) over the last decade.

### learn

### uplift

When trying to do a step forward it's good to know where you're currently standing: [open source maturity models](https://github.com/github/maturity-model#a-maturity-model-for-embracing-open-source) can help you identifying in which state your used open source projects are. But often these methodologies are fairly complex (so hard to apply) and focus on an individual projects rather than on the open source adoption phase of your organization.

Hence we're trying to use a more [lightweight open source maturity adoption model](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/mike-milinkovich/maturity-models-open-source-adoption) based on the [Eclipse Foundations view](https://de.slideshare.net/IanSkerrett/why-open-source-governance-matters) when classifying actions taken:

As for [Baloise](https://www.baloise.com/en/home.html) we're currently just in the state of getting significant business attention.

#### deny

Open source has no value or we’re not using it.

#### use

Passive use of [FLOSS][foss].

#### contribute

Contribute code and / or resources (such as feedback, documentation, ...).

#### champion

Executive support, project leadership: your project itself is widely in the state of 'use' by others.

#### collaborate

Defined business model based on [FLOSS][foss], and drive projects to achieve business goals.

#### redefine

Design products so that they can be based on [FLOSS][foss], obtain competitive advantage by harnessing changes in multiple ecosystems.
